# catRlog
### A photo-ID project management system based in R

**`catRlog`** was originally produced as a downloadable folder system -- essentially a simplistic version of an `R` package -- in association with [this publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs42991-021-00158-7) in a special issue in the *Journal of Mammalogy* (also viewable [here](https://rdcu.be/csdPC)). We have since converted `catRlog` to a proper `R` package in order to make it easier to use, maintain, and improve upon. The documentation in this vignette, and also within the help documentation for the `R` functions, provide the most up-to-date support. 

**[A user's guide vignette is available here.](https://ericmkeen.github.io/catRlog/)**
